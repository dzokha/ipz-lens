## Overview

**SDN-FlexShield: Sentinel** is an open-source browser extension that improves user cybersecurity awareness through explainable, client-side phishing detection.

The system analyzes web content locally using interpretable security indicators and transparent risk scoring. Instead of only flagging suspicious websites, it explains why a warning is triggered, helping users understand online threats, preserve privacy, and make safer browsing decisions.

### Design Goals
| Goal                      | Description   |
| :---                      | :---          |
| **Explainable Security**  | Provides clear, human-readable risk indicators so users understand *why* a site is risky. |
| **Privacy First**         | No user data collection, tracking, or exfiltration. Analysis happens locally. |
| **Client-Side Analysis**  | Zero dependency on backend servers for real-time analysis.                    |
| **Research-Oriented**     | Built as a baseline system for academic study and AI-enhanced extension.      |

## Core Features & Detection Framework

Sentinel analyzes the currently visited website using a set of **seven technical risk indicators** derived from common phishing and web-based attack techniques (aligned with MITRE ATT&CK TA0001).

### The 7-Point Indicator System

1.  **Domain Analysis**
2.  **URL & Link Analysis**
3.  **SSL/TLS Certificate**
4.  **Form Analysis**
5.  **Content Analysis**
6.  **Source Code & DOM Structure**
7.  **Language and Keyword Frequency Analysis**


## Privacy & Data Protection

We adhere to the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

| :---                                                    | :---                                             |
| Analyzes URLs locally within the browser instance.      | ❌ Collect browsing history.                     |
| Displays security indicators in real-time.              | ❌ Store, transmit, or sell user data.           |
| Optionally resolves DNS via public DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).| ❌ Track user behavior or analytics.             |
| Fully auditable client-side logic                       | ❌ Communicate with proprietary backend servers. |

> **Security Note:** No user data ever leaves the browser environment. All logic is transparent and auditable.
